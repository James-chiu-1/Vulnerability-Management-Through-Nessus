# Vulnerability Management Through Nessus</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project we are going to looking for vulnerabilities and creating a malicious enviorment. In this environment we will run some vulnerability scan and remediate the created situation. The main goal of this project is to fimilair ourselves with Nessus, understand Vulnerability management, vulnerability scans, how to create a mal;icious environment, and how to remediate the issues. 

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>services used </h2>

- <b>Nessus (SIEM)</b> 

- <b>Virtual Machines</b> 

- <b>VMware Workstation Player</b>

- <b> Once we have all of our application downloaded we want to start off with a credentialed and non-credentialed scan. Before we can do any of this we need to know our VM's IP address. Go to Command Prompt and type ipconfig.

- <b> Open the command prompt on your own pc and ping the VM.

 <h2>Program walk-through PT.2:</h2>

 
  - <b> Now we are going to set the VM to accept authenticated scans and then we're going to provide some credentials to Nessus. With credentials we are going to run a credentialed scan to the VM to see the new results. 
 
 
  - <b> Enable Remote Registry on your VM desktop which will allow your desktop to scan the VM's registry. Type Services on the desktops search. look for Remote Registry and change the start up type to "automatic".

  - <b> Go to Advanced shared setting and make sure network discovery and printer sharing is on. Nest go to User accoutn control settings and pull down the bar to Never notify.

  - <b> We are going back to the Registry to add a key to further disable user account control. Click on LOCAL_MACHINE>SOFTWARE>MICROSOFT>WINDOWS>CURRENTVERSION>POLICIES>SYSTEM. In SYSTEM we will be adding a REG_DWORD Lfile called local acoount token filter policy and then set the value to 1. Go ahead and restart your VM now.

  <h2>Program walk-through PT.3:</h2>

 
  - <b> Now we can run our credentialed scan on Nessus. Go back you Nessus then myscans. Check the box on our noncredentialed scan we did earlier. Go to More>Configure>Credentials>Windows on this tab we are oging to enter in the credentials for our virutal machine. Cllick save and go back to My Scans and run the scan.

 <h2>Program walk-through PT.4:</h2>

 
  - <b> Now we are going to add in an old version of Morzilla Firefox and has Nessus scan for this vulnerability and we will be remediating it. 
 
  - <b> Go ahead and download 3612 Firefox on your VM.
 
  - <b> Now with our outdated Firefox downloaded we can do another credentialed scan to see if it shows up on Nessus.
 
 
 
  - <b> As you can see Nessus has found more vulnerabilities
 
 
   <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gH8h9Qa.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/> 
 
 
  - <b> Now we go to Remediations to see how to fix these issues. It states we need to update morzilla firefox.

 <h2>Program walk-through PT.5:</h2>

 
  - <b> We are going to remediate the vulnerabilities found in Nessus now. Go to your VM search for Run>appwiz.cpl>uninstall firefox or update it. Go to Windows Update and update all needed updates.
 
 
  - <b> Go back to Nessus and run another credentialed scan. You can see we have successfully remedaited the vulnerabilities and our risk levels are at an acceptable level.
