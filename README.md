 <h2>Program walk-through PT.2:</h2>

 
  - <b> Now we are going to set the VM to accept authenticated scans and then we're going to provide some credentials to Nessus. With credentials we are going to run a credentialed scan to the VM to see the new results. 
 
 
  - <b> Enable Remote Registry on your VM desktop which will allow your desktop to scan the VM's registry. Type Services on the desktops search.
